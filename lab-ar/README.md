In this AR Project, a ferris wheel will appear, slowly rotating, when the AR image is revealed.
This brings me back to the glory days of Rollercoaster Tycoon 1 and 2, a gateway for players to create their own amusement park
just the way they like it. I'd love to see collectable cards one could mix and match to create their own rides and attractions
in the same fashion.
